			<span class="caption">Floydware Privacy Policy</span>

			<p class="incipit">Floydware is committed to protecting your privacy. We make our online games available for download on supported devices through Google Play. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, store, use and distribute information about our users through our apps.</p>

			<span class="subcaption">Consent</span>

			<p>
			By using our apps you consent to the use of your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy.Please note that it is always your choice whether or not to provide Personal Information.
			</p>
			<p>
			Two types of information may be collected through the Services: Personal Information and Non-Personal Information. This Privacy Policy does not extend to the collection, use or disclosure of the following information which is currently not limited by applicable privacy laws: (a) information that is publicly available, such as names, addresses, telephone numbers and electronic address when listed in a directory or made available through directory assistance; or (b) Non-Personal Information (as defined further below).
			</p>
			<p class="indent1">
			“Personal Information” is personally identifiable information, such as your name and e-mail address. We may retain this information for the purpose of providing the Services and for communication with you.
			</p>
			<p class="indent1">
			“Non-Personal Information” is information of an anonymous nature, such as device data and information which our app may automatically collect for bug tracking purposes.
			</p>
			<p>
			The obligations in this Privacy Policy relate to Personal Information, however, we provide information about our use of Non-Personal Information for the sake of transparency with respect to the operation of the Services.
			</p>
			<span class="subcaption">Types of Information Collected</span>

			    <p class="indent1">Device IDs: When downloading or installing our apps, information such as a unique device identifier will be provided to us. We use this information for bug tracking and statistic purposes. The unique device identifier does not include, or give access to the owners name, address or other personal information registered to that device. Additionally, we may access third party information such as your phone or Facebook contacts provided you allow your device to connect to services and you have given the application permission to access this information. We may only collect this information with your authorization and according to the rules you have established within your device permissions.
			    </p>
			    <p class="indent1">
			    Support: If you send an email or otherwise communicate with Floydware, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our Services.
			    </p>

			<span class="subcaption">Disclosures & Transfers</span>

			<p>
			Organizational safeguards are in place to ensure a high level of protection of your Personal Information. We will not disclose or transfer your Personal Information to third parties without your permission, except where specified in this Privacy Policy (see Important Exceptions below).
			</p>

			<span class="subcaption">Important Exceptions</span>
			<p>
			We may disclose any Personal Information we hold about you to third parties without your consent if we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identifying, contacting or bringing legal action against someone who may be causing injury to, or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally), our rights or property, other users of the Services, or anyone else (including the rights or property of anyone else) that could be harmed by such activities. We may disclose Personal Information when we believe in good faith that such disclosure is required by and in accordance with the law.
			</p>
			<span class="subcaption">Third Party Sites & Advertisers</span>
			<p>
			Advertisements appearing within our Apps may be delivered by us or one or more third-party web advertisers. Wherever you click on an advertisement, you may be taken to another service where we do not monitor or control your privacy. Third party web advertisers may collect data to allow the advertisement server operated by that third party to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. Accordingly, advertisement servers may compile information about where or whether you viewed their advertisements and which advertisements you clicked on. Floydware Privacy Policy does not cover the use of your data by any third-party web advertisers and you should consult the applicable privacy policy for the relevant third-party web advertiser(s).
			</p>
			<span class="subcaption">Security</span>
			<p>
			The security of your Personal Information is very important to us. We have procedures in place that limit the dissemination of your Personal Information to only such designated staff as necessary.
			</p>
			<span class="subcaption">Retention</span>
			<p>
			Any Personal Information that we keep will be held only for as long as it remains necessary for the identified purpose, or as required by law, which may extend beyond the termination of our relationship with you. We may retain particular data where necessary to prevent fraud, future abuse, or for legitimate business purposes such as analysis of aggregated, non-personally-identifiable data, account recovery, and where required by law. All retained Personal Information will remain subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy.
			</p>
			<span class="subcaption">Amendment of this Policy</span>
			<p>
			We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time. If changes are made to this Privacy Policy in the future, an appropriate notice will be posted on the app page within Google Play. Any non-material change (such as clarifications) to this Privacy Policy will become effective on the date the change is posted and any material changes will become effective 30 days from their posting on the Website. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Policy applies to all Personal Information. The date on which the latest update was made is indicated at the bottom of this document. Your continued use of the Services signifies your acceptance of any changes.
